- For game level 3 and 4, when a certain letter is expected to be typed, I would like to display 5 fingers on the left side and 5 fingers on the right side at the bottom of the card, and then show which finger the user is supposed to use to type that letter.

# m1b
- In chunk.js, ask "What is this?" as the question, before following up with "How do you spell ...".

# m1c
- In chunk.js, add a few more stages between "What word is this?" and "How do you spell ...".
- E.g. If the word is "ma-ple", add these stages
  - When space is pressed, utter "ma"
  - When space is pressed, utter "ple"
  - When space is pressed, utter "maple".
